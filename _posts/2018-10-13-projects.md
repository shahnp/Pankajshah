      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```
2. R
R code block:
```r

4. Inline Sanple Code

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Mountain_Nepal.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Mountain_Nepal.png)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
