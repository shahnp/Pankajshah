    import Pandas as pd

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```
2.
R code block:
```r
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
url<â€“"https://data.boston.gov/dataset/311-service-requests"
df <- read_csv(url) # Reading boston 311 csv file
head(df)
```
3.
SQL code block

```
{sql connection=}
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1 ;
```
4. Inline Sample Code

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Mountain_Nepal.png" alt="linearly separable data">

Here's Same image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Mountain_Nepal.png)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
