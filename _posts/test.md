The single-layer Perceptron is the simplest of the artificial neural networks (ANNs). It was developed by American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in the 1950s.

Like Logistic Regression, the Perceptron is a linear classifier used for binary predictions. This means that in order for it to work, the data must be linearly separable.
